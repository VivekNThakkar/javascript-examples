2. How JavaScript Works 🔥& Execution Context | Namaste JavaScript Ep.1
JS is synchronous single-threaded language. Single threaded => js can execute one command at a time. synchronous => js can execute code in a specific order. JS can only go to next line once the current line has been finished executing
Everything in javascript happens inside an "Execution context"

Execution context has 2 components in it => 
1. memory component (variable environment) => all variables and functions are stored as a key:value pair
2. code component (thread of Execution) => this is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

3. How JavaScript Code is executed? ❤️& Call Stack | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 2
When we run JS program, a Global Execution context is created.

Execution context is created in 2 phases => 
1. Memory Creation phase => JS allocates memory to all the variables (var) (key name => name of variable. value => undefined) AND functions (function) (key name => name of function. value => whole code of the function).
2. Code Execution phase => JS once again runs through the whole JS program line by line & it executes the code now. As soon as JS encouters var n=2, it replaces the value of n by 2 in memory (replaces undefined by 2).
Function invokation => whenever a function is invoked, a new Execution context is created (inside the Global Execution context's code Execution phase). This new Execution context again has 2 phases => memory Creation and code Execution phase . Memory allocation of variables and functions present inside the function takes place.
Once the whole function is executed, this newly created Execution context (for that instance of that function) will be deleted as soon as function returns.
Once whole JS program is finished running, the whole Global Execution context also gets deleted.

JS manages all Execution context Creation, deletion, and the control => using stack (call stack) .JS has its own call stack.
Call stack => everytime in the bottom of the stack, we have our Global Execution Context. Whenver JS program is run, this call stack is populated with this Global Execution context.
Whenever a function is invoked, a new Execution context is created, this is put inside the stack. As soon as function returns, this new execution context gets poped out of the stack and control gets back to the next element in the stack.
Again when a function is invoked, same process happens.
After whole JS program is executed, Global Execution context is also popped out of the call stack and call stack gets empty
CAll stack => is only for managing these Execution contexts.
Call stack maintains the order of Execution of Execution contexts
Call stack is also known as => Execution context stack, program stack, control stack, runtime stack, machine stack

4. Hoisting in JavaScript 🔥(variables & functions) | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 3
Even before the code in JS starts executing, the memory is allocated to each and every variable (var) and functions (function).
In case of variables, variable name get memory allocated with its value as undefined.
In case of function, function name get memory allocated with its value as the whole code of the function.
But if an arrow function/ normal function is saved in a variable, it wont be saved in memory during the memory Execution phase

not defined => variable is not present in the code. Reference error
undefined => variable is present, but no value is assigned to that variable

We can check the global Execution context on browser by putting a debugger and searching inside "sources" -> "scope"

How functions work in JS ❤️ & Variable Environment | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 4
var => functional scoped
if a variable is not found in a function, it will search for that variable outside that function (function's parent function)

SHORTEST JS Program 🔥window & this keyword | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 5
Empty file => is the shortest JS program
JS engine creates "window" and "this"
window => a object with lot of functions and variables. These are created by JS engine into the global space. We can access this anywhere in our JS program
At global level, "this" points to the "window" object .
"window" is actually a global object which is created along with the Global execution context.
Whenver any JS program is run, a global object (window, incase of browser) is created, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is created and aling with that Execution context a "this" variable is created.

JS engine in chrome is v8. Firefix, safari, internet explorer has its own engine.
All these JS engines has a responsiblity to create this global object

Global Object => incase of browser it is known as "window". incase of node it is something else. Wherever you run the JS program, it is different. But global object is always created.
Even if JS file is empty, a global object is created.

At the global level / base level / at the global Execution context,   this === window  // true
But inside any function,   this === window // false


Whenever a Execution context is created, a "this" is created along with it. Even for the functional Execution context anf global Execution context. 
And at global level, "this" points to "window" (incase of browser) object.

Any code in JS which is not inside a function is in global space
If any code is inside any function, then that code is not in global space
If we try to put any variable / function in "global space", these variables and functions gets attached to that global object (window, incase of browser). We can access that using "window" , window.variable_name or directly with the name variable_name (It assumes that youre referring to the global space).

undefined vs not defined in JS 🤔 | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 6
When JS allocates memory to all the variables and functions, to the variables it tries to put a placeholder undefined. undefined is like taking memory.
Not defined => when a variable has not been allocated memory

JS is a loosely typed language (weakly typed language) => you can assign any datatype to the same variable anytime.
